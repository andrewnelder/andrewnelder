#Introduction

This code is everything that is currently up and running on my site.  With exception to the images, it's free to use for your own non-commercial purposes.  Furthermore, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about it (provided they're not trolling).  It's a simple piece of code, but it's structurally correct.
