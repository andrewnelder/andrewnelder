###Introduction
This is a collection of all of the files necessary to run the andrewnelder.com domain.  The site is written for use with bottle.py; however, at this point in time, it takes advantage of very few of the framework's features.

###Requirements
- Python 2.6/2.7
- Bottle.py

###To-do
- Clean up and document.
- Replace the Javascript functions with Python functions in-line.  Significantly more efficient that way.
